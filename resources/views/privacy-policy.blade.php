We send cookies to your device to uniquely identify your browser and improve the quality of our Service. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your device&#39;s hard drive while you are viewing a site. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).
